There’s a lot of jargon in coding that doesn’t make sense to a non-coder or a newcomer. That’s no fun because such jargon intimidates people from making the jump into the wonderful world of code!

That’s why I’m translating a bunch of terms that come up a lot in tech literature and conversations…I want you to learn how to code!

# The terms

algorithm invariant  
amortized analysis  
asynchronous  
bulletproof code  
casting  
composition  
concurrency  
covariant  

**DEPLOYMENT**: all of the activities that make a software system available for use. (Credit: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_deployment).) Separate from tasks such as editing content, designing an interface, or coding the functionality of a software project, deployment is often a final stage and the specific process of pushing or publishing a software project to an access point for others to use.

DRY  
expressive  
eviction  
Extract/Transform/Load (ETL)  
fault tolerance  
fuzzing  
Hindley-Milner  
homoiconicity  
idempotence  

**IDIOMATIC**: Code written in the accepted style of its language community. For example, Ruby code written with a `for` loop would likely be unidiomatic because usage of methods from [Enumerable](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Enumerable.html) is preferred by most Ruby developers. Idiomatic code is often considered easier to read.

immutability  
interface  
invalidation  
iterable  
iterator  
load balancing  
loose coupling high cohesion  
memoization  
module  
mutable API  
MVC (Model/View/Controller)  
MVCC (Multiversion concurrency control)  
MVP (Model/View/Presenter)  
MVVM (Model/View/ViewModel)  
observable  
observer  
orthogonal  
paradigm  
performant  
pipe/piping/pipeline  
principle of least surprise  
reification  
serialization/marshalling  
single responsibility  
single source of truth

**STAGING**: The testing process - and often an entire environment - that allows review of a software project. A virtual "kicking of the tires," staging a project typically happens in a private, test environment where it can be put through some simulated, real-world-like use as a way to avoid unpredicted failures. Staging often happens as the step before deploying or publishing software to a non-test, production environment.

state machine
sticky load balancing
synchronous    
(syntactical) sugar  
TDD/BDD  
thread safe  
void (js)  

**YAGNI**: An acronym that stands for "You aren't gonna need it." Following
this principle, a developer shouldn't add something to their code until it's
actually necessary. This is to prevent developers from focusing too much
energy on areas they *think* might be important in the future, but which
ultimately turn out to be superfluous to the end product.

There’s a lot of jargon in coding that doesn’t make sense to a non-coder or a newcomer. That’s no fun because such jargon intimidates people from making the jump into the wonderful world of code!

That’s why I’m translating a bunch of terms that come up a lot in tech literature and conversations…I want you to learn how to code!

# The terms

algorithm invariant  
amortized analysis  
bulletproof code  
casting  
composition  
covariant  
DRY  
expressive  
Extract/Transform/Load (ETL)  
fault tolerance  
fuzzing  
Hindley-Milner  
homoiconicity  
idempotence  
idiomatic  
immutability  
interface  
iterable  
iterator  
loose coupling high cohesion  
mutable API  
observable  
observer  
orthogonal  
paradigm  
performant  
principle of least surprise  
reification  
serialization/marshalling  
single responsibility  
single source of truth  
state machine
(syntactical) sugar    
TDD/BDD  
thread safe  
void (js)  

**YAGNI**: An acronym that stands for "You aren't gonna need it." Following
this principle, a developer shouldn't add something to their code until it's
actually necessary. This is to prevent developers from focusing too much
energy on areas they *think* might be important in the future, but which
ultimately turn out to be superfluous to the end product.
